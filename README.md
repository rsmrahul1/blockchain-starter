# blockchain-starter
You can use this as the starting point of the learning of blockchain and crypto currency implementation.

## Prerequisites
    1. Install node

## Steps to run :
  ### Step 1
    Clone this repo
  ### Step 2 
    Go to the location from command prompt (cd <path>)
  ### step 3 
    run 'npm install'
  ### step 4 
    run 'node FirstCryptoCurrency.js' 
  
## Terms used in the sample
  ### 1. Blockchain 
      Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties 
      efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.
  ### 2. Block  
      A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. 
      Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data
  ### 3. Proof of work 
      Proof of work describes the process that allows the bitcoin network to remain robust by making the process of mining, 
      or recording transactions, difficult.
  ### 4. Crypto currency 
      A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography,
      which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
      Cryptocurrency is typically decentralized digital money 
  ### 5. Blockchain Hash Function 
      A hash function takes an input string (numbers, alphabets, media files) of any length and transforms it into a fixed length. 
      The fixed bit length can vary (like 32-bit or 64-bit or 128-bit or 256-bit) depending on the hash function which is being used. 
      The fixed-length output is called a hash. 
      This hash is also the cryptographic byproduct of a hash algorithm.
