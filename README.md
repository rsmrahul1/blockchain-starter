## Terms used in the sample
  
  ### 1. Blockchain <br />
      Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.
  
  ### 2. Block  <br />
      A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data
  
  ### 3. Proof of work <br />
      Proof of work describes the process that allows the bitcoin network to remain robust by making the process of mining, or recording transactions, difficult.
  
  ### 4. Crypto currency <br />
      A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.<br />  Cryptocurrency is typically decentralized digital money
