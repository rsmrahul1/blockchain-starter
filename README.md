## Terms used in the sample
  ### 1. Blockchain 
      Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties 
      efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.
  ### 2. Block  
      A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. 
      Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data
  ### 3. Proof of work 
      Proof of work describes the process that allows the bitcoin network to remain robust by making the process of mining, 
      or recording transactions, difficult.
  ### 4. Crypto currency 
      A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography,
      which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
      Cryptocurrency is typically decentralized digital money 
  ### 5. Blockchain Hash Function 
      A hash function takes an input string (numbers, alphabets, media files) of any length and transforms it into a fixed length. 
      The fixed bit length can vary (like 32-bit or 64-bit or 128-bit or 256-bit) depending on the hash function which is being used. 
      The fixed-length output is called a hash. 
      This hash is also the cryptographic byproduct of a hash algorithm. 
  ### 6. SHA-256
      SHA-256, or Secure Hash Algorithm 256, is a hashing algorithm used to convert text of any length into a fixed-size string of 256 bits (32 bytes).
      SHA-256 is also used in popular encryption protocols such as SSL,TLS, SSH and open source operating systems such as Unix/Linux. 
      SHA-256 is a popular hashing algorithm used in Bitcoin encryption, first introduced when the network launched in 2009. 
      Since then, SHA-256 has been adopted by a number of different blockchain projects.
  ### 7. Blockchain Nonce
      Nonce, short for “number used once”, is a random number that can only be used one time. 
      Nonces are generated for a specific use, most often to modify the result of a function in a cryptographic communication. 
      Discovering the next block is done by finding the right nonce, 
      that when combined with the previous block hash, provides a lower hash value than the target.  
      This specific nonce that satisfies the mining requirement of the next block is called the “Golden Nonce”.
  ### 8. Genesis Block
      A Genesis Block is the name given to the first block a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, ever mined. 
      A blockchain consists of a series of so-called blocks that are used to store information related to transactions that occur on a blockchain network.
  ### 9. Mining
      Mining is the process that Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies use to mint new coins and verify and secure their blockchains. 
      The competitive process that verifies and adds new transactions to the blockchain for a cryptocurrency that uses the proof-of-work (PoW) method. 
      The miner that wins the competition is rewarded with some amount of the currency and/or transaction fees.
